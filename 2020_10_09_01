Implement Undo and Redo features of a Text Editor
Given an array of strings Q[], consisting of queries of the following types:
•	“WRITE X”: Write a character X into the document.
•	“UNDO”: Erases the last change made to the document.
•	“REDO”: Restores the most recent UNDO operation performed on the document.
•	“READ”: Reads and prints the contents of the documents.

Example
Input: Q = {“WRITE A”, “WRITE B”, “WRITE C”, “UNDO”, “READ”, “REDO”, “READ”}
Output: AB ABC
Explanation:
Perform “WRITE A” on the document. Therefore, the document contains only “A”.
Perform “WRITE B” on the document. Therefore, the document contains “AB”.
Perform “WRITE C” on the document. Therefore, the document contains “ABC”.
Perform “UNDO” on the document. Therefore, the document contains “AB”.
Print the contents of the document, i.e. “AB”
Perform “REDO” on the document. Therefore, the document contains “ABC”.
Print the contents of the document, i.e. “ABC”
Input: Q = {“WRITE x”, “WRITE y”, “UNDO”, “WRITE z”, “READ”, “REDO”, “READ”}
Output:xz xzy

Solution:

q = []
query = []
undo_query = []
output_string = ""
#input from user
while True:
    q.append(input())
    if q[-1] == "":
        q.pop()
        break
 
for i in q:
    if i[0]== "W":
        output_string += i[-1]
        query.append(i[-1])

    elif i[0] == "U":
        j = query.pop()
        output_string = output_string.replace(output_string[-1], '')
        undo_query.append(j)

    elif i[0] == "R" and i[-1]== "D":
        print(output_string, end=" ")
    elif i[0] == "R" and i[-1]=="O":
        q1 = undo_query.pop()
        output_string += q1
