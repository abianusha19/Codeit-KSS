Problem Description
You are given N sticks of varying lengths. You need to determine whether it is possible to form a polygon of positive area by arranging them in some order. For example, if three sticks of lengths 1, 1, 1 are given we can easily see that we can form a triangle by arranging them in order. On the other hand, if the sticks have lengths 1, 2, 1, then we cannot form a polygon of non-zero area with these.
Constraints
1 <= N <= 100
Length of any stick will be less than 100

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N indicating number of sticks
The next line contains N space separated positive integers giving the lengths of the sticks
Output
One line containing the number of sides of the polygon of most sides (of at least 3 sides) that can be formed with some of the sticks. If no polygon can be formed, the output should be 0.
Explanation
Example 1
Input
3
1 1 1
Output
3
Explanation

N=3, and there are 3 sticks, each of length 1. With three sticks of length 1, we can form a triangle

Solution:

import java.util.*;
public class polygon
{

static int checkPolygon(int sum,int array[])
{
PriorityQueue<Integer> pq=new PriorityQueue<Integer>(Collections.reverseOrder());
for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++)
{
pq.add(array[i]);
}
while(pq.size()>=3)
{
if(sum-pq.peek()>pq.peek())
{
	
return pq.size();
}
else
{
sum-=pq.peek();
pq.poll();
}
}
return 0;
}

public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
int n=sc.nextInt();
int arr[]=new int[n];
int sum=0;
for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
{
arr[i]=sc.nextInt();
sum+=arr[i];
}
System.out.print(checkPolygon(sum,arr));
}
}
